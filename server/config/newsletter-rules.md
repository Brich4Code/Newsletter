Hello Jumble Newsletter Rules
Last updated: 2025-08-15
Core Principles
No two part headers and no punctuation in headers (no dashes, colons, commas).
Headers use Title Case.
No em dashes and no unnecessary hyphens.
Every fact must be recent and verified. If uncertain, label as unverified or omit.
Embed links over natural anchor text only. Never show bare URLs.
Link Embedding Standard
Use natural noun phrase anchors of 3 to 9 words.
Do not lead with “According to”. Only use explicit attribution when naming a person or entity that is the subject.
Link the first mention only and use each exact URL once across the newsletter.
No bare URLs. Strip tracking parameters (utm, ref, share). Prefer canonical URLs.
Place anchors over claims or nouns, not over punctuation.
Do not include outlet names in anchors unless the outlet itself is the subject.
For videos or posts, use a descriptive anchor such as “the video report” or “the statement on X from Name”. Prefer the publisher page over rehosted clips.
Section Structure And Word Counts

H2 adds a distinct angle.
One intro paragraph, then space for image.
Body with two to three H2s, each with an emoji.
ex. (
The long-standing legal and, sometimes personal battle between Elon Musk and OpenAI is officially moving to a jury trial scheduled for late March 2026. This week, a federal judge rejected OpenAI’s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that there is at least enough evidence suggesting OpenAI leaders made assurances that the organization would remain a nonprofit. So, the next step is to let a jury decide the truth.

Musk, who provided roughly $38 million in early funding, claims the shift to a "capped-profit" model and the multibillion-dollar deal with Microsoft constitute a breach of contract and a betrayal of the organization’s founding mission to benefit humanity.


🏛️ The Core Allegations of a Betrayal of Trust
At the heart of the lawsuit is the founding agreement that Musk insists existed back in 2015. He contends that his financial support was predicated on the understanding that OpenAI would develop AGI for public benefit, unencumbered by shareholder interests. OpenAI, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman have denied these claims, labeling Musk a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to hamper a market leader.

The judge’s decision to let a jury weigh the evidence means internal OpenAI documents and communications will likely be scrutinized in open court, potentially revealing sensitive details about the company's evolution and its relationship with Microsoft.


🔮 Potential Outcomes and the Future of AI Models
If the jury finds in favor of Musk, the consequences could be catastrophic for OpenAI's current valuation. Musk is seeking unspecified ill-gotten gains, but a ruling could theoretically impact how AI companies transition from nonprofits to commercial giants. Beyond the finances, the trial could force OpenAI to open-source more of its technology, a key demand of Musk’s initial suit.

With Musk’s own xAI currently valued at over $230 billion, this trial is as much about market dominance as it is about legal ethics. The outcome will likely set a major precedent for how the biggest names in tech manage the tension between altruistic goals and massive profits.")
Target length about 400 words.
Embed reputable, recent sources. Add placeholders for posts or video when needed.
Secondary Story
H1 with emoji in the front (ex. 🧠 Gemini Evolves Into Your Personal Assistant)
One intro paragraph.
One to three H2s with emojis 
(Ex. 'Google has officially entered the era of Personal Intelligence with a new beta rollout for its Gemini app. This update represents a foundational shift from a generic chatbot to an assistant that truly "speaks fluent you." By securely linking your personal context from Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube, Gemini can now cross-reference your history to provide one-of-a-kind answers.


Whether you are hunting for a specific tire size mentioned in an old email or trying to replicate a vacation vibe from five years ago, the new engine retrieves and reasons across your own data to find the needle in the digital haystack.

🛡️ Privacy Focused Controls for Sensitive Data
Transparency is the backbone of this new personal era. Personal Intelligence is entirely optional and off by default, giving users granular control over which Google apps are connected. You can manage your "Connected Apps" settings at any time, deciding exactly how much of your world you want Gemini to see.


Google has also built in safeguards to ensure transparency: Gemini will attempt to reference the specific email or photo it used to formulate an answer, allowing you to verify the information. This beta is currently available for AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the U.S. across web, Android, and iOS.

🚲 Intelligent Suggestions Tailored to Your Habits
The power of this feature lies in its ability to synthesize disparate details into cohesive plans. Instead of generic restaurant lists, Gemini can build travel itineraries based on your hotel reservations, flight times, and the aspirational spots you’ve saved in Search.

It can even help with big purchases by researching products that fit your specific needs and past preferences. By remembering your hobbies and life goals, the AI offers suggestions that feel more like advice from a close friend than a search engine result. It is a bold step toward AI that doesn't just process information but understands your personal narrative.')

Zapier Tutorial - How to Make Your First Zap

Here’s what to do (check out the video above if you get stuck):

1️⃣ Identify the repetitive task: Pick one small chore that takes up 10 minutes of your day. For example : summarizing a specific weekly newsletter or drafting a generic reply to "is this still available" marketplace inquiries.

2️⃣ Set the trigger: Use your no-code tool to create a trigger. If you're summarizing an email, set it to : "New Email matching search."

3️⃣ Connect the AI brain: Add a step to send that content to an AI model like ChatGPT or Claude. Give it a simple prompt : "Extract the three most important points from this text."

4️⃣ Define the action: Tell the tool where to send the output. You can have the summary sent to your Slack, your notes app, or even back to your email as a draft.

5️⃣ Turn it on: Watch your agent handle its first task. Once you see the magic of a "digital employee" working for you, you'll never go back to manual chores! '

Ex. 2 '🎁 Step 1: Pick three constraints

Give ChatGPT your rules in one message: budget, time limit, and who is in the room. Add one “no phones” window to make it real.

🍪 Step 2: Turn one idea into action

Have ChatGPT generate two menu options, then use your grocery app choice to turn the winning option into a cart. If you want zero friction, choose delivery over a store run.

🎶 Step 3: Lock the vibe

Ask for a playlist plan based on the group’s ages and energy, then push it into your music app so it is not just text.

🧩 Step 4: Add one interactive moment

Have ChatGPT create a 12 question family quiz that includes two questions per person, based on memories everyone can verify. Keep it fast, keep it funny, and end with one “future plan” question.

📸 Step 5: Make a keepsake

Ask for a one page recap you can paste into a group chat tomorrow morning: what you did, what surprised you, and one photo prompt for next year’s card.')
